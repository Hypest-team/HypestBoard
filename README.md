# Scoreman
Stream overlay software for Super Smash Brothers for use with OBS/Xsplit and the respective BrowserSource plugins.

# Using

## Downloading
Download the latest "stable" release [here](https://github.com/N0NamedGuy/scoreman/releases/latest). You can find older released versions on https://github.com/N0NamedGuy/scoreman/releases/.

If you love living in the bleeding edge, you may check the builds done at every push done to the repository. Keep in mind these might be broken, so buyer beware:

* Go to the Actions page https://github.com/N0NamedGuy/scoreman/actions
* Select one of the commits
* Get the binaries from the artifact list

## Running

To use, just launch the executable, and play around!

Now what is left to be done is to fill in the data.

## OBS Setup

After opening the application:

* Navigate down to the **Overlays** section.
* Preview and choose your favourite overlay.
* Click the "Copy" button. This will put an the overlay's URL in your clipboard.
* On OBS create a Browser Source, and use that link you have copied to your clipboard.
  - Be sure to set the **width** and the **height** to the size of your OBS canvas (usually 1280x720 or 1920x1080)
  - Carefully adjust the FPS as well, as to save CPU. If the overlay you have chosen doesn't have the need for fluid/smooth animations setting FPS to 30 or below should suffice
* Add the remainig sources, like window or video captures.

Keep in mind that once you close the app, all the data there will be lost, and OBS won't be able to display the overlay.

# Building

First, make sure you have the latest version of NodeJs installed on your machine. You can get it here https://nodejs.org/en/download/ or install it on your system using a package manager of some kind.

After that you'll need to checkout this repository into your local machine. Use your favorite GUI git client or just do in a console or terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/N0NamedGuy/scoreman/
cd scoreman
```

This is a monorepo, that is based on yarn workspaces. You will need to install and setup [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (this can take a bit):
```
npm install -g yarn # run as root if it doesn't work
```

After having yarn set up, you can install all the dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

Now that we have all the dependencies, we need to build any necessary files (this also can take a bit):
```
yarn run build
```

Finally, we are good to go to launch the application!

# Running Scoreman
Scoreman is ready to use at

* Linux: `./packages/standalone/dist/Scoreman-{version}.AppImage`
* Windows 7/8/10: `./packages/standalone/dist/Scoreman-{version}.exe`
* OSX: *untested*

Now you can start setting scores!

# OBS configuration
To start using the overlay inside OBS, expand the **overlays** section,
and pick the overlay you want to use.

For now (we are in very, *very* early alpha) you can right click the desired overlay, and copy paste it into a Browser source on OBS.

Every time you change the scores (and don't forget to press the Update button!) they will show up on your OBS scene...!

You are all done!
